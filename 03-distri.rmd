# Common Families of Distributions

## Introduction

Statistical distributions are used to model populations; as such, we usualy deal with **a family of distributions** rather than a single distribution.

This family is indexed by one or more parameters, which allow us to vary certian characteristics of the distribution while staying with one functional form.

## Discrete Distributions

**Discrete Uniform Distribution**

A random variable X has a discrete uniform (1,N) distribution if

$$P(X=x|N) = \frac{1}{N}, x = 1,2,3,...,N$$,

where N is a specified integer.
