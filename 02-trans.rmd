## Distributions of Functions of a Random Variable

If X is a random variable with cdf $F_X(x)$, then any function of X, say g(X), is also a random variable. We set Y=g(X), then

$$P(Y \in A) = P(g(X) \in A)$$

Formally, if we write y = g(x), the function g(x) defines a mapping from the original sample space of X, $\mathcal{X}$, to a new sample space, $\mathcal{Y}$, the sample space of the random variable Y. That is,

$$g(x): \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$$

We associate with g an inverse mapping, denoted by $g^{-1)$,

$$g^{-1}(A) = \{ x \in \mathcal{X}: g(x) \in A\}$$

If the random variable Y is now defined by Y = g(X), we can write for any set $A \subset \mathcal{Y}$,

$$P(Y \in A) = P(g(X) \in A) = P(\{x\in\mathcal{X}: g(x) \in A\} = P(X \in g^{-1}(A))$$

If Y is a discrete random variable, the pmf for Y is

$$f_Y(y) = P(Y=y) = \sum_{x \in g^{-1}(y)}P(X=x) =\sum_{x \in g^{-1}(y)}f_X(x),\text{ for }y \in \mathcal{Y}$$

It's easiest to deal with function g(x) that are monotone, that is those that satisfy either increasing or decreasing. It the transformation x --> g(x) is monotone, then it is one-to-one and onto from $\mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$.

**Theorem 2.1.3**

Let X have cdf $F_X(x)$, let Y = g(X), and let $\mathcal{X} = \{ x: f_X(x) > 0\}$, $\mathcal{Y} = \{y: y = g(x)\text{ for some }x \in \mathcal{X}\}$.

- If g is an increasing function on $\mathcal{X}$, $F_Y(y) = F_X(g^{-1}(g))\text{ for }y \in \mathcal{Y}$
- If g is a decreasing function on $\mathcal{X}$ and X is a continuous random variable, $F_Y(y) = 1-F_X(g^{-1}(y))\text{ for }y \in \mathcal{Y}$

## Expected Values

**Definition 2.2.1**

The **expected value** or **mean** of a random varaible g(X), denoted by E(g(X)), is

$$E(g(X)) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(x)f_X(x)dx$$, if X is continuous

$$E(g(x)) = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} g(x)f_X(x) = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} g(x)P(X=x)$$, if X is discrete,

provided that the integral or sum exists.
